"""
WAP to delete duplicates from the a sorted array and return the number of valid numbers
O(n) complexity with O(1) space complexity
Logic: since array is sorted, repeated elements must appear one-after the another.
So we do not need an auxiliary data structure (dictionary) to check if an element
has appeared already (A[i]) == A[i-1]. We move just one element, rather than entire sub array to the left
