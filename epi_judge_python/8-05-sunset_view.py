Write a program that processess buildings from east-to-west order, and returns the set of buildings which view the sunset.
Each building is specified by a size
#basically, you maintain a stack of buildings that can view the sunset
If a incoming building is taller than building at the top of stack, we keep popping it untill we find a building taller then
