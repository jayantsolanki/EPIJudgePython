"""
Write a program that takes two cycle-free linked lists and determines 
if there exists a node that is common to both lists.
Brute force: store one list in a hash map and iterate the other to find out common node
Better:
The lists overlaps if and only if both have same tail node.; once the lists converge at a node
they cannot diverge at a later node. Thus finding the tail node will be sufficient
To find the first overlapping node, we first compute the length of each list.
The first overlapping node is determined by advancing through the longer list by the difference in lengths,
and then advancing through both lists in tandem, stopping at the first common node. If no common node, then no overlap
Time: O(N)
