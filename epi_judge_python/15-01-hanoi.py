The only way to solve the puzzle was to build interim towers on the different pegs
ou start at the bottom, not the top! Hereâ€™s how it works. If all the disks are on Peg A at the left, and you need to move them all to Peg C on the right, then you need to move the bottom disk, the largest one, to Peg C. Obviously.
Only way you can release nth disk is by building a n-1 disk tower on the empty area.

To do that, you need to build an interim tower on Peg B with the next largest disk at the bottom. And to do that, you need to build an interim tower on Peg C with the next largest disk.

Towers of Hanoi: In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one).
Time: O(2^n)

The largest disk moves exactly once, to the left (wrapping around). The second-largest disk moves twice, both times to the right, which matches the algorithm: it moves right to allow the largest disk to move left, and then right again to land on top of it. The third-largest disk moves four times, to the left each time, and the pattern continues for bigger towers. So we know two things: each disk has a preferred direction, and the full solution for N disks has (1 + 2 + ... + 2^(N-1)) == (2^N) - 1 total moves. The iterative algorithm looks like this:

define hanoi(N):
    repeat 2^N - 1 times:
        move the largest disk that can go in its preferred direction

You have the following constraints:

(1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
(2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
(3) A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk. Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the
last using Stacks.

The pattern here is :
 - Shift 'n-1' disks from 'origin' to 'buffer', using destination.
 - Shift last disk from 'origin' to 'destination'.
 - Shift 'n-1' disks from 'buffer' to 'destination', using origin.

moveDisks(int n, Tower origin, Tower destination, Tower buffer) {

/* Base case */
if (n <= 0) return;

/* move top n - 1 disks from origin to buffer, using destination as a buffer. */
moveDisks(n - 1, origin, buffer, destination);

/* move top from origin to destination
moveTop(origin, destination);

/* move top n - 1 disks from buffer to destination, using origin as a buffer. */

moveDisks(n - 1, buffer, destination, origin);
}
