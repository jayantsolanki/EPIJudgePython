Leetcode 71 https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/
Write a program which takes a pathname, and returns the shortest directory paths.
Logic: Ignore ., and handle .. by popping the stack, if string starts with / then you 
cant go up, record it in a stack. Insert everything else in the stack
We may encounter a .. when stack is empty, this shows a path begining with an ancestor name
 we will then need to record that ..
Final result is the state of the stack after loop finishes
